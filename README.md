# How to use
1. Join a server then enable the "Enable Vote-Name" checkbox.
2. Select whether you want to use any modifiers or not. (Auto Disconnect, Hide Name Change, etc....)
3. Select the message type. (Ban or Vote)
4. Select whether you want the value to be taken from the console or not. (Read below for console commands)
6. Input your custom message/name into the textbox. (You don't have to do this if you are setting value through the console)
7. Press the "Set Name" button.
8. For Ban-name attack a teammate or use auto-disconnect to make the message appear in the chat, and for Vote-name call a vote to make the fucked up voting screen appear.

# How to install
1. Download the Lua into the folder where csgo is installed. (located in "Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive")
2. Inject the cheat, load the Lua.
3. Extend the menu of the cheat by dragging it outwards from the bottom right to make the Lua tab visible. (make sure "lock menu layout" in the misc section is disabled)

# Shit to keep in mind when using this
1. Both of the message types perform a name change which is visible on the scoreboard. ( Unless you use "Hide Name Change")
2. Don't save configs with the "Enable Troll-Name" checkbox enabled.
3. Unchecking the "Enable Troll-Name" Reverts your name back to the original value.
4. All menu elements are located in the "LUA" tab under the sub-tab "A".
5. For console values, "r_eyegloss" is for Ban-name and "r_eyemove" is for Vote-name.
